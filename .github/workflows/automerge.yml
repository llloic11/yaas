name: Auto-merge youtube-dl updates
# GitHub explicitly declined to implement auto-approval of Dependabot PRs to
# prevent a compromised dependency from propagating quickly. We do it anyway
# because:
# 1. youtube-dl functionality breaks, and is fixed, rapidly. Not keeping
#    youtube-dl up to date means that yaas breaks.
# 2. yaas doesn't store any personal information.
# 3. I don't want to have to manually open and approve PRs all the time.
# So the tradeoff is worth it. I mean, it's a side project.
